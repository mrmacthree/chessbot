TODO

1)  Slowly clean up libs (ie: Combine .h and .cpp and see what difference is
    made in performance)

2)  Move everything from lib to src and remove lib. Modify the libs from
    chess-test dir and use update to move libs to other dirs

3)  Add threading

4)  Simplify and speed up certain movements (AlignToEdge(), Center(), etc...)
